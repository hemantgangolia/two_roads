I have completed the core functionality for one day.
But couldn't complete for multiple days because of time constraints.

The code is scalable for multiple restos, menus, ingredients and dishes; and follows OOP principles.

I have applied a simple prediction strategy of just adding 10 of each ingredient.

I maintain a separate state of inventory with extra field for storing the number of days since the ingredient was bought in a file "inventory_state_with_expiry.txt"


Instructions:

(1) g++ single.cpp && ./a.out

Sample Input:

ingredients.txt, menus folder containing menu for each restaurant, dishes.txt, orders.txt

and inventory_state.txt (containing state of inventory for last day)

Sample output:

(1) Inventory suggestions

(2) State of Inventory pre-opening
